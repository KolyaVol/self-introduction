Hello! My name is Nikolai, I am 24 years old, and I live in Minsk. Since childhood, I was interested in solving logical problems and creating something new. So I have a high engineering education in field of chemical process technology from BSTU. 
After graduation, I started working at the design institute as engineer. But three months later was drafted into the army. There I had some good friends and they were inspired me to learn JS. So I started almost immediately and by the end of the army I read books on algorithms and JS. 
Upon returning, I continued to work at the design institute and actively promoted new design techniques and developed documentation for them. Also, I developed such skills as teamwork, communication between departments and structural thinking. 
Every evening I have been studying web programming for a year. During this time, I learned the basic concepts of JS, worked with ts, made several applications on React JS, learned a lot of techniques and design approaches. And I have enough knowledge to create different kinds of web applications. 
My most challenging project is an online electronics store on React. The project includes a shopping cart, login, individual product pages, sliders, animations, responsive and semantic layouts, and BEM styles. Additionally, I have implemented my portfolio on React Redux TS with a dark or light theme change and two languages and an interesting skill animation.
Thanks for watching to this moment and at the end I want to say that really enjoy programming because it offers me development, and such great feellings when you find that filthy mistake and see, that project start working as it should. It's making my heart beat faster. 
Bye and Good luck!
